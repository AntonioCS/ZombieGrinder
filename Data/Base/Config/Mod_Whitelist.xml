		This file defines what resources can be modified by end-users for the purposes of modding.

		If any greylisted files are modified then the game will become highly restricted - saves will not work,
		achievements will not work, games cannot be played on VAC servers, etc.

		If the user wants to lift these restrictions, they must upload the greylisted mod to 
		the workshop and ask an admin to whitelist the mod. (Ask infinitus@zombiegrinder.com)
		
		Any resources marked with server-enforced are required to be the same on the client and server, 
		meaning the server and client must have the same mods installed. Resources not marked as such
		can be modified freely on the local-server.
		
		Blacklisted files can never be modified by unsigned end-user mods, and the game will refuse to start
		if they are modified.

 	<!-- 
		Scripts are greylisted as its both easy to cheat, and do naughty things with the users computer. They are 
		enforced as not doing so will cause gameplay differences between client and server, causing desyncs.

 	<!-- 
		Config files are blacklisted as they define engine configuration that should never be modified by the end-user,
		such as this whitelist.

	<!--
		Tilesets are server-enforced as they define collision as well as appearence. They are not grey-listed though as 
		custom maps may want their own tilesets.

	<!--
		Effects are server-enforced as they define damage related properties. They are not greylisted however as users
		may wish to make custom weapons etc.
	-->

	<!--
		Maps are server-enforced for fairly obvious reasons. They are greylisted to prevent users doing things such
		as just spawning a million chests in a room -_-, or other similarly cheating things.
