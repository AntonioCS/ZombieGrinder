Fix: (B#349) Paralysis weapons (shock rifle/freezey ray/etc) no longer gives infinite score. It gives a large score bonus on first hit, then never again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.16.99
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modify: Shuffled #version tag in shaders to top of file, the intel compiler seems to have issues if it comes after a comment block.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.16.92
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add: New fallback method to the opengl renderer. Allows the game to fallback to a fixed-function-pipeline rendering mode if any shaders fail to load or the GPU dosen't support FBO's/Shader's. Can also be enabled in advanced-graphics-options if the user wishes, may give a performance benefit as less RT bandwidth is used.
Performance: Optimized some of the collision manager code, should cut a good 50% off its execution time. As its run on another thread, it dosen't directly affect the hot path though :(.
Add: Initial support for runtime localization editing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.16.62
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modify: Dungeon difficulty now ramps up harder on each successive level.
Modify: Dungeon level bonus is now calculated based on the score you acquired on the current level, not the total score. Otherwise score just compounds to stupidly high amounts.
Fix: (B#332) Potential crash in the particle-fx sound manager.
Modify: Additional support for unicode input on windows and linux.
Fix: Couple of buffer overruns.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.15.88

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.15.29
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modify: Slightly improved collision boxes of grenades.

Fix: (B#319) Chest objects somehow got disabled, resulting on incorrect animations on clients.
Fix: (B#322) Freeze / Incendiary attachment particles leaving behind their collision after the visual component was destroyed. Resulting in enemies 'magically' freezing/set-on-fire when they passed through the invisible collision left behind.
Modify: Active skills are disabled in PVP games now.
Modify: Disable accidently enabled infinite-active-skill cheat!
Modify: Ammo regen to be less abusable - only regens the current weapons reserve ammo, and only after not firing for 15 seconds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.15.17
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added: New particle effects for active skills to make it more obvious when they are in use!
Fix: (B#3312) Modified font renderer to continue processing even after encountering invalid unicode characters. Prevent text being truncated. Unicode input is still pretty bust and needs a lot of work, but better than nothing.
Fix: Correct handling of rerolling skills when you have purchased items that cannot be rolled back (instant skills, gold, items, etc).
Fix: (B#309) Wave game modes no longer despawn wave-important enemies (only fodders).
Fix: Null-ref exception in scripts when possessing a null object (removing possession).
Modify: Various sound effects have been modified to be slightly more pleasent on the ears :).
Modify: Further rebalancing of scores recieved and lost for different actions.
Modify: Multipliers can now be lost if there is a long time between kills.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.13.72
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add: Some ambient particle effects to levels (butterflys etc).
Add: Some initial remote-debugging support, should help pin down some more difficult to repro bugs. Run game with -monitor_enable 1 to enable. Can have a heavy performance cost.
Add: Some debug methods to simulate latency and jitter.
Add: Debug rendering of collision now includes line-traces and intersection-points.
Fix: Radial damage from explosions being inverted. Further away the more damage -_-
Fix: Incorrect assignment of user game-states on server if the user begins loading the next map before the server. Resulting in situations where you would be permanently stuck on 'Syncronising with server...'
Fix: Depth sorting of various fences, doors and other objects in various levels.
Fix: Beam particle effects (lazer cannon etc) not behaving correctly - the line intersection function had some maths that went crazy at certain angles -_-.
Fix: Beam effects not being despawned when the lazer cannon is forcibly unequipped - through death or gun-game weapon-switch.
Fix: Legs moving with bizzare animation speeds when sprinting.
Fix: Initial spawn state of objects not being correctly synced - most noticable in pvp game modes where clients would not update the game mode state correctly (stuck on 'Waiting for players' during game etc).
Fix: Enemies no longer spawn directly on you in dungeon arenas.
Fix: Not taking fire-damage from molotovs.
Fix: Gaining XP by healing player that is at max health.
Fix: Player characters snapping to integer-coordinates when still for several frames. Was originally designed to reduce pixel-shimmer on static-decals, accidently got applied to players!
Fix: Rescued survivors are now synced correctly and have increased depth-bias so they don't clip between map layers.
Fix: Disable inventory drops and allow selling forheads: bison, bsod, cheer bringer.
Fix: CTB now correctly creates compass pips for bag carrier.
Fix: Trying to give user out-of-range weapons in gun-game.
Fix: Fix for crash when closing the game while there are active connections.
Fix: Only local players now play hurt sounds, less confusion all around!
Modify: Getting to the end of a dungeon map will despawn you with a nicer effect, rather than just triggering the default-death effect. Better distinction between success and death.
Modify: Heavily changed the snapshot interpolation system, should reduce latency and prevent simulation drifting out of sync. Things may not move quite as smooth though, WIP.
Modify: Health regen passive skills and weapon-mods now require user to take no damage for 15s before starting regeneration.
Modify: Console window no longer tracks main-window, until main window is moved.
