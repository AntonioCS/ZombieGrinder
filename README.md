At this point in time the project is on indefinite hiatus for various internal reasons. Due to that, the source is now available for those who wish to experiment with it.

No warrenty or documentation is available, if you contact me I may be able to give suggestions.

Please be aware, a lot of this was written when I was less experienced, there are many instanes of poor practice. So don't use this to learn :)
